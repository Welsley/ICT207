========================

Archive of one of my university's group projects. We are to extend on an existing project by a past student. They have modeled a portion of my university's campus and we are to add an "access" point to our own project within it. Once "accessed" our portion of code will run. We have decided on a simple game where the player needs to collect a golden key to escape back to the university campus. The key is, however, hidden behind locked rooms. To access these rooms, they player will need to combat zombies to gain silver keys. Zombies touching the player will cause the player to lose health. Upon reaching 0 health, they player loses and restarts. Each room the player opens with a silver key will increase the maximum amount of zombies in the game.
